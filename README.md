# WRF-WVTs
Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with moisture tracers

----

The implementation of moisture tracers, or water vapor tracers (WVT), in a regional model, allows users to track moisture from any possible source within the simulation domain. Therefore, this moisture tracing tool is especially appropriate for researchers interested in moisture source studies. 

Users should follow the next steps to run WRF with tracers.
