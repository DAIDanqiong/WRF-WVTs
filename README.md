# WRF-WVTs
Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with moisture tracers

----

The implementation of moisture tracers, or water vapor tracers (WVT), in a regional model, allows users to track moisture from any possible source within the simulation domain. Therefore, this moisture tracing tool is especially appropriate for researchers interested in moisture source studies.
